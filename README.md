# GRIP Task 1 Notebook

## Overview
This notebook, developed as part of the Graduate Rotational Internship Program (GRIP), focuses on data analysis and visualization. Created and run in Google Colab, it leverages popular Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and seaborn.

## Prerequisites
- A Google account for accessing Google Colab.
- Basic knowledge of Python and data analysis libraries.

## Libraries Used
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `NumPy`: For numerical operations.
- `Matplotlib`: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- `seaborn`: For statistical data visualization.

## Dataset
The dataset is accessed directly via an online URL, likely in CSV format, and is used for various data analysis tasks within the notebook.

## Key Features
- **Data Loading**: The notebook includes code for loading data from an online source.
- **Data Exploration**: It performs initial data exploration such as examining the dataset's structure, summary statistics, and first few records.
- **Visualization**: There are likely plots and charts to visualize data insights.

## How to Run
1. Open Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Import the `GRIP_TASK1.ipynb` notebook into Colab.
3. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis. Make sure you're connected to the internet for data fetching and library installations.
